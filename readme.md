The Self-consistent Quasi-1D (SQu1D) code is an object-oriented
code written in the C++ language and is intended to be run in
parallel on multiple processors. The code is used for simulating
magnetic field guided plasmas using a quasi-one-dimensional
fully kinetic approach. The code is a variant of Particle-In-Cell (PIC) technique.
